  #### possible ways of playing ####

Player may move freely if the dungeon[in our case called hotel]since the action takes place in the hotel where Ardit was murdered. They can access rooms if the doors are unlocked. Some doors will always be locked, some will get unlocked if they finish the puzzle or find the key, from previous rooms. Some rooms are required to get in, some are just optional and just give you a bonus [e.g gives you a gun]. Some rooms contain hints to end the game faster.

---------- Task3: Development Steps ----------

- Create intro interface
- Create help menu
- Create map and zone interface
- Create interactive text messages

# Tehnical Development

- Create Player Class
- Create Path methods
- Create Action methods
- Create Puzzle methods
- Create Player Inventory & ability to use items
- Create Room dictionary with all room information

# Actions per mapzone

- Examine [F]: may trigger certain events such as discover an item that gets stored in an inventory and saved, discover a hint or initiate a fight.
- if action =  discover item: Pick up action becomes available
- if action =  hint: nothing happens
- if action =  fight: Flee, Hide and Attack available. Sometimes Flee or hide might not work 
- if action =  attack: Player gets asked to roll the dice. Based on a random number generator, he takes damage or gives damage modifying self.hp from Player Class.

# Dialog and other NPC

- Dialogs are a really important aspect of the game. Every answer you give might help you finish the game faster. Player is always given multiple options of questions
or answers to ask. For example:
    """ You meet Arthur """
    1. Hey, who are you?
    2. Did you know Ardit?
    3. Did you kill Ardit?

- Every question or answer will initiate another path. Asking Arthur if he killed Ardit might make him not answer any other question in the future.
